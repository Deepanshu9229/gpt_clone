# GPT Clone with Advanced File Upload System

Hey there! üëã This is my take on building a ChatGPT-like app that actually handles files really well. I got tired of ChatGPT's limited file support, so I built something that can actually read and understand your documents, spreadsheets, and images.

## What Makes This Cool

### ü§ñ Smart AI Chat
- **Multiple AI Models**: I've integrated Claude, GPT-4, Groq, and others so you can pick what works best, but for now all other API's are paid so only Groq is mentioned and working.
- **Real Conversations**: It remembers what you talked about and keeps context
- **Live Responses**: AI replies stream in real-time, just like the real ChatGPT

### üìÅ File Upload That Actually Works
- **Drag & Drop**: Just drag files right into the chat - no more clicking through menus
- **Reads Everything**: PDFs, Word docs, Excel sheets, CSV files, text files - you name it
- **AI Gets It**: The AI actually reads your files and can answer questions about them
- **Smart Processing**: Automatically extracts text and figures out what's in your files
- **Cloud Storage**: Uses Cloudinary so your files are safe and accessible

### üîê Security That Makes Sense
- **Clerk Auth**: Clean, simple login that just works
- **Your Data Stays Yours**: Conversations and files are private to your account
- **No API Key Leaks**: Environment variables keep everything secure

### Backend
- **API Routes**: Simple, clean endpoints
- **MongoDB**: Stores your conversations and file info
- **Smart Processing**: Uses the right tool for each file type
- **AI Integration**: Works with multiple AI providers

### File Processing
```
Upload ‚Üí Figure Out What It Is ‚Üí Extract Content ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Give to AI ‚Üí Get Smart Response
```

## How to Use It

### Uploading Files
1. Click the paperclip in the chat
2. Drag files in or pick them from your computer
3. Wait for it to process (usually just a few seconds)
4. The AI will automatically read and understand your file

### Chatting with Your Files
1. Upload something (PDF, Word doc, Excel sheet, etc.)
2. Ask questions about what's in it
3. Get smart answers based on your actual content
4. Keep chatting - the AI remembers your files

### Managing Files
- See processing status in real-time
- Get summaries of what's in your files
- Remove files when you're done
- Track file info and size

## When Things Go Wrong

### Common Problems
- **File Won't Process**: Check if it's under 10MB and in a supported format
- **AI Not Talking**: Make sure your API keys are set up right
- **Upload Issues**: Double-check your Uploadcare setup

### Debug Commands
```bash
npm run db:test      # Test if database is working
npm run test:app     # Test the whole app setup
npm run setup        # Reconfigure everything
```

## Deploying

### Vercel (Easiest)
1. Connect your GitHub repo
2. Add environment variables in Vercel
3. Push to GitHub and it deploys automatically

### Other Platforms
- Make sure all environment variables are set
- Check your MongoDB connection string
- Verify your file upload service credentials
